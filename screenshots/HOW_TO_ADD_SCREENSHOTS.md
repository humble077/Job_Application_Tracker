# How to Add Screenshots

Based on the screenshots you've taken, please save them with these exact filenames in this `screenshots/` folder:

1. **login-page.png** - Your login page screenshot
2. **dashboard.png** - Your dashboard screenshot  
3. **applications-table.png** - Your applications table screenshot

## Steps:

1. Save your screenshot files in this `screenshots/` folder
2. Make sure the filenames match exactly:
   - `login-page.png`
   - `dashboard.png`
   - `applications-table.png`
3. The README.md is already updated to reference these images
4. After adding the files, commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add screenshots/*.png
   git commit -m "Add screenshots for login, dashboard, and applications table"
   git push
   ```

## Screenshot Requirements Met:

✅ Login Page - Shows the login form with email/password fields
✅ Dashboard - Shows summary statistics cards and recent applications
✅ Applications Table - Shows the table with search, filter, sort, and applications
